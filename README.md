How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

My primary focus when developing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to abstract my code making sure that every possible element is modular. I find that this way of doing things is more work upfront but pays off in the end. I feel like I achieved this in my CRUD Python module but would have preferred to abstract elements of my dashboard further into maybe even other files. Honestly, my CRUD module is decent and is something I could see myself further working on to turn it into something I could use in the future.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach my problems by focusing on goals over everything else. I currently work as a Product Owner for a small tech company and this was something I learned early on when it came to managing a backlog. I always start by writing user-need and problem statements. I find that if I adhere to these statements I don't get lost in meeting my client's needs.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve problems using hardware and software. The work that a computer scientist does provides companies, like Grazioso Salvare, with the tools they need to do their work better.
